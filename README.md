- The model that predicts whether someone is likely to be working at baseline is Model_Part_1.R, and uses Naive Bayes.

- The model that predicts whether someone is likely to be working after 6 months is Model_Part_2.R, and uses KNN. It also runs a hierachical clustering model to explore the data.

- The cleaning script is Cleaned_Data.R

- The script Exploration_of_Model_Part_2.R, was used to investigate which models were best for model 2. We included some of the insights there as well. Have a look if you'd like to see what other models were tried!

Cheers!
