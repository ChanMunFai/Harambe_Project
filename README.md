The model that predicts whether someone is likely to be working at baseline is Model_Part1.R, and uses Naive Bayes.

The model that predicts whether someone is likely to be working after 6 months is Model_Part2.R, and uses KNN.

model_2.R also runs a hierachical clustering model to explore the data.

The script Exploration_of_Model_Part_2.R, was used to investigate which models were best for model_2. We included some of the insights there as well. Have a look if you'd like to see what other models were tried!
